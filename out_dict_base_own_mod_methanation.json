The key challenge at present relies on the design and exploration of non-noble metal catalysts so as to achieve high activity at a low reaction temperature. In this work, we have obtained alkaline-assisted Ni nanocatalysts supported on Mg/Al mixed metal oxides (denoted as Nix/Mg2-xAl-MMO) derived from Ni-Mg-Al hydrotalcite precursors. The catalytic performance toward CO2 methanation was studied in detail, and the best low-temperature reaction activity was obtained over Ni/MgAl-MMO (CO2 conversion: 97.9%; selectivity: 97.5%; 250 \u00b0C). By establishing the correlation between the catalytic performance and the alkaline site structure, it is found that the Ni nanoparticles and MgO base sites at the interface serve as dual active centers to cooperatively catalyze CO2 methanation, resulting in low-temperature reaction activity. Moreover, in situ diffuse reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (in situ DRIFTS) demonstrates that MgO acts as the active site for CO2 activation to give carbonate/hydrocarbonate species, while Ni provides H-species for further hydrogenation of intermediates. Therefore, this work rationalizes the significant influence of alkaline-assisted Ni nanoparticles on CO2 methanation, which provides a promising heterogeneous catalyst for this reaction."}, "1": {"man": 19, "man_labels": {"Reactant": 4, "Product": 0, "Characterization": 5, "Reaction": 9, "Catalyst": 10, "Treatment": 1}, "base_model": 15, "base_model_labels": {"Reactant": 4, "Product": 0, "Characterization": 5, "Reaction": 3, "Catalyst": 8, "Treatment": 1}, "recall": 0.7894736842105263, "precision": 0.8266666666666668, "st_dev": 0.28905977851571735, "doi": "10.1007/s11705-016-1563-5", "token_man": {"Mn-promoted 15 wt-% Ni/Al2O3": "Catalyst", "incipient wetness impregnation": "Treatment", "Mn": "Catalyst", "Ni/Al2O3": "Catalyst", "CO2 methanation": "Reaction", "comethanation": "Reaction", "CO": "Reactant", "CO2": "Reactant", "N2 physisorption": "Characterization", "hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction and desorption": "Characterization", "carbon dioxide temperature-programmed desorption": "Characterization", "X-ray diffraction": "Characterization", "highresolution transmission electron microscopy": "Characterization", "Ni particle": "Catalyst", "Mn-promoted 15 wt-% Ni/ Al2O3 catalysts": "Catalyst", "1.71Mn-Ni/Al2O3": "Catalyst", "co-methanation": "Reaction", "1.71Mn-Ni/ Al2O3": "Catalyst", "CO methanation": "Reaction"}, "token_mod": ["comethanation", "Al2O3", "incipient wetness impregnation", "co-methanation", "N2 physisorption", "hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction and desorption", "MnNi", "1.71MnNi", "CO2", "X-ray diffraction", "Mn", "carbon dioxide temperature-programmed desorption", "highresolution transmission electron microscopy", "Ni", "CO"], "abstract": "A series of Mn-promoted 15 wt-% Ni/Al2O3 catalysts were prepared by an incipient wetness impregnation method. The effect of the Mn content on the activity of the Ni/Al2O3 catalysts for CO2 methanation and the comethanation of CO and CO2 in a fixed-bed reactor was investigated. The catalysts were characterized by N2 physisorption, hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction and desorption, carbon dioxide temperature-programmed desorption, X-ray diffraction and highresolution transmission electron microscopy. The presence of Mn increased the number of CO2 adsorption sites and inhibited Ni particle agglomeration due to improved Ni dispersion and weakened interactions between the nickel species and the support. The Mn-promoted 15 wt-% Ni/Al2O3 catalysts had improved CO2 methanation activity especially at low temperatures (250 to 400 \u00b0C). The Mn content was varied from 0.86% to 2.54% and the best CO2 conversion was achieved with the 1.71Mn-Ni/Al2O3 catalyst. The co-methanation tests on the 1.71Mn-Ni/Al2O3 catalyst indicated that adding Mn markedly enhanced the CO2 methanation activity especially at low temperatures but it had little influence on the CO methanation performance. CO2 methanation was more sensitive to the reaction temperature and the space velocity than the CO methanation in the co-methanation process.

There are several critical requirements on the methanation catalysts. They need to be sufficiently active at low temperatures, resistant against sintering at high temperatures, and are resistant to other deactivation phenomena, for example gum and carbonyl formation.

The synthesized Ni nanocatalysts maintained the nanosheet structure of the LDHs, in which Ni particles were decorated with MnOy species and embedded in the AlOx nanosheets.

Microchannels coated with a Ru/SiO2 and a Ru/Al2O3 catalyst were used at standard residence times of about 300 ms. The methanation allowed to remove CO almost completely from the gas flow at a temperature of 300 \u00b0C using a Ru/SiO2 catalyst. Although oxygen was added to the feed, the CH 4-selectivity was still 95% at temperatures of 350 \u00b0C using the Ru/SiO2 catalyst. It can be shown, that the CO conversion is higher at temperatures between 140 and 200 \u00b0C under oxidizing conditions because CO can be converted to CO2. For temperatures from 200 to 320 \u00b0C the amount of oxidized H2 increases more than the amount of oxidized CO and consumes most of the O2. In parallel, CO methanation is increasing temporarily up to 250 \u00b0C with increasing temperature maybe due to formation of Run+ sites so that the CH4 space time yield by CO methanation is also higher than that by CO2 methanation. At temperatures between 250 and 300 \u00b0C a local minimum in methane formation from CO methanation is determined which might be attributed to a considerable decrease in Run+ sites by oxygen consumption. The CH4 space time yield by CO methanation clearly decreases with H2O co-feed compared to the same conditions but without water over the reaction temperature range examined. If CO (in a mixture of CO and CO2) has to be converted over a Ru/SiO2-catalyst by methanation a sufficient amount of O2 has to be added and temperature has to be controlled precisely. Because of the inner dimensions and the enhanced heat transfer coefficients of the microchannel reactor the latter demand can be met very easily. Temperature ranges can be controlled precisely, which is important to maximize the ratio of CH4 space time yield by CO to CO2 methanation. The experiments demonstrate that the microchannel reactor is an excellent tool for studying the reaction network of methanation of CO in presence of oxygen, CO2 and hydrogen without heat transfer limitation. \u00a9 2005 Elsevier B.V.
