The key challenge at present relies on the design and exploration of nonnoble metal catalysts so as to achieve high activity at a low reaction temperature. In this work, we have obtained alkaline-assisted Ni nanocatalysts supported on Mg\/Al mixed metal oxides (denoted as Nix\/Mg2−xAl-MMO) derived from Ni-Mg-Al hydrotalcite precursors. The catalytic performance toward CO2 methanation was studied in detail, and the best low-temperature reaction activity was obtained over Ni\/MgAl-MMO (CO2 conversion: 97.9%; selectivity: 97.5%; 250 °C). By establishing the correlation between the catalytic performance and the alkaline site structure, it is found that the Ni nanoparticles and MgO base sites at the interface serve as dual active centers to cooperatively catalyze CO2 methanation, resulting in low-temperature reaction activity. Moreover, in situ diffuse reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (in situ DRIFTS) demonstrates that MgO acts as the active site for CO2 activation to give carbonate\/hydrocarbonate species, while Ni provides H-species for further hydrogenation of intermediates. Therefore, this work rationalizes the significant influence of alkaline-assisted Ni nanoparticles on CO2 methanation, which provides a promising heterogeneous catalyst for this

The catalysts were characterized by N2 physisorption, hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction and desorption, carbon dioxide temperature-programmed desorption, X-ray diffraction and highresolution transmission electron microscopy. The presence of Mn increased the number of CO2 adsorption sites and inhibited Ni particle agglomeration due to improved Ni dispersion and weakened interactions between the nickel species and the support. The Mn-promoted 15 wt-% Ni\/ Al2O3 catalysts had improved CO2 methanation activity especially at low temperatures (250 to 400 °C). The Mn content was varied from 0.86% to 2.54% and the best CO2 conversion was achieved with the 1.71Mn-Ni\/Al2O3 catalyst. The co-methanation tests on the 1.71Mn-Ni\/ Al2O3 catalyst indicated that adding Mn markedly enhanced the CO2 methanation activity especially at low temperatures but it had little influence on the CO methanation performance.

This contribution illustrates how catalysts are tested for high temperature methanation, taking into account these challenges, in order to allow for more competitive and flexible plant design"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2024-06-28T11:37:18.649080Z","updated_at":"2024-06-28T12:01:35.832289Z","inner_id":5,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":28,"annotations":[{"id":36,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":46,"end":58,"text":"nickel-based","labels":["Catalyst"]},"id":"nS2TVhnXuG","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":72,"end":90,"text":"syngas methanation","labels":["Reaction"]},"id":"OZ2m44Qc51","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":184,"end":186,"text":"CO","labels":["Reactant"]},"id":"kkPyzzzglM","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":220,"end":248,"text":"formation of nickel carbonyl","labels":["Reaction"]},"id":"MmfW3gNrey","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":333,"end":358,"text":"dispersed Ni nanocatalyst","labels":["Catalyst"]},"id":"q68LQRgrlb","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":371,"end":416,"text":"reduction of NiMnAl-layered double hydroxides","labels":["Treatment"]},"id":"QIGHPaOLrd","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":418,"end":429,"text":"NiMnAl-LDHs","labels":["Catalyst"]},"id":"HSXu-Eeu2g","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":451,"end":469,"text":"syngas methanation","labels":["Reaction"]},"id":"_kiYbDmsu-","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":487,"end":502,"text":"Ni nanocatalyst","labels":["Catalyst"]},"id":"pEDkFXYrvM","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":546,"end":549,"text":"LDH","labels":["Catalyst"]},"id":"Ch9yjRh1RH","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":594,"end":598,"text":"MnOy","labels":["Catalyst"]},"id":"eqYNh8xljm","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":627,"end":641,"text":"AlOx nanosheet","labels":["Catalyst"]},"id":"Rg--56SFwk","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":669,"end":684,"text":"Ni nanocatalyst","labels":["Catalyst"]},"id":"eCKpckZgmX","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":773,"end":791,"text":"syngas methanation","labels":["Reaction"]},"id":"ryBWj5tuLh","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":912,"end":915,"text":"CH4","labels":["Catalyst"]},"id":"y-PEx4EI7l","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":890,"end":892,"text":"CO","labels":["Reactant"]},"id":"ojHQkQ_T23","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":1054,"end":1069,"text":"NiMnAl catalyst","labels":["Catalyst"]},"id":"iFNX2-T6LR","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":1263,"end":1267,"text":"MnOy","labels":["Catalyst"]},"id":"BwOShFPQ_e","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":1296,"end":1300,"text":"AlOx","labels":["Catalyst"]},"id":"rDVO530hua","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2024-06-28T12:10:25.643437Z","updated_at":"2024-06-28T12:10:25.643437Z","draft_created_at":"2024-06-28T12:07:02.955336Z","lead_time":528.284,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"70e77836-44f9-4678-aeab-7764b3c15f00","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":28,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"4edb2155-methanation_unlabeled.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"uid":6,"text":"Increasing the low-temperature performance of nickel-based catalysts in syngas methanation is critical but very challenging, because at low temperatures there is high concentration of CO on the catalyst surface, causing formation of nickel carbonyl with metallic Ni and further catalyst deactivation. Herein, we have prepared highly dispersed Ni nanocatalysts by in situ reduction of NiMnAl-layered double hydroxides (NiMnAl-LDHs) and applied them to syngas methanation. The synthesized Ni nanocatalysts maintained the nanosheet structure of the LDHs, in which Ni particles were decorated with MnOy species and embedded in the AlOx nanosheets. It was observed that the Ni nanocatalysts exhibited markedly better low-temperature performance than commercial catalysts in the syngas methanation. At 250 \u000eC, 3.0 MPa and a high weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 30,000 mL\u0001g􀀀1\u0001h􀀀1, both the CO conversion and the CH4 selectivity reached 100% over the former, while those over the commercial catalyst were only 14% and 76%, respectively. Furthermore, this NiMnAl catalyst exhibited strong anti-carbon and anti-sintering properties at high temperatures.

successful application of a microchannel reactor to reduce the CO content by methanation in a model gas mixture containing CO, CO2, O2 and H2 can be shown. Microchannels coated with a Ru\/SiO2 and a Ru\/Al2O3 catalyst were used at standard residence times of about 300 ms. The methanation allowed to remove CO almost completely from the gas flow at a temperature of 300 8C using a Ru\/SiO2 catalyst. Although oxygen was added to the feed, the CH4-selectivity was still 95% at temperatures of 350 8C using the Ru\/SiO2 catalyst. It can be shown, that the CO conversion is higher at temperatures between 140 and 200 8C under oxidizing conditions because CO can be converted to CO2. For temperatures from 200 to 320 8C the amount of oxidized H2 increases more than the amount of oxidized CO and consumes most of the O2. In parallel, CO methanation is increasing temporarily up to 250 8C with increasing temperature maybe due to formation of Run+ sites so that the CH4 space time yield by CO methanation is also higher than that by CO2 methanation. At temperatures between 250 and 300 8C a local minimum in methane formation from CO methanation is determined which might be attributed to a considerable decrease in Run+ sites by oxygen consumption. The CH4 space time yield by CO methanation clearly decreases with H2O co-feed compared to the same conditions but without water over the reaction temperature range examined. If CO (in a mixture of CO and CO2) has to be converted over a Ru\/SiO2-catalyst by methanation a sufficient amount of O2 has to be added and temperature has to be controlled precisely. Because of the inner dimensions and the enhanced heat transfer coefficients of the microchannel reactor the latter demand can be met very easily. Temperature ranges can be controlled precisely, which is important to maximize the ratio of CH4 space time yield by CO to CO2 methanation. The experiments demonstrate that the microchannel reactor is an excellent tool for studying the reaction network of methanation of CO in presence of oxygen, CO2 and hydrogen without heat transfer limitation."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2024-06-28T11:37:18.649080Z","updated_at":"2024-06-28T12:20:14.589284Z","inner_id":7,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":30,"annotations":[{"id":38,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":89,"end":100,"text":"methanation","labels":["Reaction"]},"id":"dQ82ECcVXr","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":304,"end":306,"text":"H2","labels":["Reactant"]},"id":"GffZxcusQ4","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":307,"end":310,"text":"CO2","labels":["Reactant"]},"id":"nzn1UYxWVH","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":503,"end":505,"text":"H2","labels":["Reactant"]},"id":"B4CfIEYhxO","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":506,"end":509,"text":"CO2","labels":["Reactant"]},"id":"YcZmn49F9n","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":410,"end":432,"text":"substitute natural gas","labels":["Product"]},"id":"RYzfsD3ZeV","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":813,"end":824,"text":"methanation","labels":["Reaction"]},"id":"k_10gfUiIz","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2024-06-28T12:21:21.264284Z","updated_at":"2024-06-28T12:21:21.264284Z","draft_created_at":"2024-06-28T12:20:28.772787Z","lead_time":65.573,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"31e36e1c-9952-4fb8-a10e-f02f77d29103","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":30,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"4edb2155-methanation_unlabeled.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"uid":8,"text":"The performance of a slurry bubble column reactor was evaluated for its application as a methanation reactor.
