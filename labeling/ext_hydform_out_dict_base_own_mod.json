The relative simplicity of the pair site structure and sufficient description by mean-field modelling enable correlation of the experimental kinetics with first principles-based microkinetic simulations. The Rh-WOx pair sites catalyse ethylene hydroformylation through a bifunctional mechanism involving Rh-assisted WOx reduction, transfer of ethylene from WOx to Rh and H2 dissociation at the Rh-WOx interface.

In protic solvents only alcohols were produced even after short reaction times. The reactions are very rapid and also occur readily with alkenes such as hex-2-ene, propene, ethene, styrene and 3,3-dimethylbutene. The highest rates observed are for ethene (54 000 turnovers h-1) and the products in all cases are alcohols. Other phosphines containing primary alkyl groups also produced alcohols, but in contrast reactions in ethanol using rhodium complexes containing PPh3, PPh2Et, PPhEt2 or PPri3 produced significant amounts of aldehydes and/or acetals whilst Me2PCH2CH2PMe2 inhibited the reaction. The NMR studies showed that species present in equilibrium in ethanol solution are [RhH(CO)(PEt3)3], [RhH(CO)2(PEt3)2], [Rh2(CO)4(PEt3)4], [Rh2(CO)2(PEt3)6] and PEt3 but that [RhH(CO)(PEt3)3] predominates under the catalytic conditions. Reactions carried out under D2-CO in EtOH produced, 90% BuCHDCH2CD2OH/D and 10% BuCHDCH2CHDOH/D but hydrogenation of heptanal under the same conditions gave a mixture of C6H13CHDOH/D (39%) and C6H13CH2OH/D (61%). These results are interpreted to indicate that the alcohols produced from hex-1-ene are primary reaction products and not produced via intermediate aldehydes. A new mechanism for this direct hydrocarbonylation is proposed in which the key acyl intermediate becomes protonated by the alcoholic solvent because of the high electron density it bears as a result of the presence of the electron-donating trialkylphosphines. Oxidative addition of H2 followed by two H-atom transfers leads directly to the alcohol. High pressure NMR studies showed that [Rh{C(O ? HOEt)Et}(CO)2(PEt3)2] is present during catalytic hydrocarbonylation of ethene in ethanol. Two different cycles are proposed to explain the products obtained from the catalytic reaction of heptanal with D2-CO.

The propene yield and durability of Sc/In2O3 were greatly improved by addition of water and hydrogen in the reactant stream. The reaction mechanism was greatly dependent on the catalyst employed. On Ni-M41, the metathesis reaction of ethene and butenes, produced through dimerization of ethene, was a key step for the propene formation. On the remaining two oxide catalysts, the major pathways were the common: ethanol ? acetaldehyde ? acetone ? propene. The detailed reaction pathways, however, were different from each other. On Sc/In2O3, acetaldehyde was oxidized to acetic acid with water or a surface hydroxyl group and the resulting acetic acid was converted to acetone and carbon dioxide through ketonization. On the other hand, on Y2O3-CeO2, acetaldehyde was converted to ethyl acetate, and then it decomposed to form acetic acid and ethene. Acetic acid was converted to acetone and carbon dioxide in the same manner as that on Sc/In2O3. The by-production of much amounts of ethene was characteristic on Y2O3-CeO2. On the Sc/In2O3 oxide, a hydrogen molecule was active for the hydrogenation of acetone to 2-propanol.
