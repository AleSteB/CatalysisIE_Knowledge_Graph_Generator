However, these processes are differentiated in that the CO hydrogenation also requires an initial CO dissociation before catalysis can proceed. In this study, the catalytic response to changes in particle size and to the addition of metal additives was studied to elucidate the differences in the two processes. In the hydroformylation process, both hydroformylation and hydrogenation of ethylene occurred concurrently. The desirable hydroformylation was enhanced over fine Rh particles with maximum activity observed at a particle diameter of 3.5 nm and hydrogenation was favored over large particles. CO hydrogenation was favored by larger particles. These results suggest that hydroformylation occurs at the edge and corner Rh sites, but that the key step in CO hydrogenation is different from that in hydroformylation and occurs on the surface. The addition of group II-VIII metal oxides, such as MoO3, Sc2O3, TiO2, V2O5, and Mn2O3, which are expected to enhance CO dissociation, leads to increased rates in CO hydrogenation, but only served to slow the hydroformylation process slightly without any effect on the selectivity. Similar comparisons using basic metals, such as the alkali and alkaline earths, which should enhance selectivity for insertion of CO over hydrogenation, increased the selectivity for the hydroformylation over hydrogenation as expected, although catalytic activity was reduced.

In the \ufb01rst one, two separate sources of Rh and P were used. In the second one, the Wilkinson complex was employed as a unique source of Rh and P to probe the positive in\ufb02uence of the well-de\ufb01ned molecular organization on the preparation of dispersed and controlled Rh2P nanoparticles, stabilized by carbon patches formed during the pyrolysis treatment from PPh3.

Triphenylphosphine (PPh3) was used as the phosphorus source, and Rh2P supported on silica was prepared by impregnation at a relatively low temperature (550 \u00b0C). The turnover frequency (TOF) of styrene hydroformylation was increased to 1496 h\u22121, which was comparable with some single atom catalysts (SACs). Recycling tests showed a good stability in \ufb01ve runs. Furthermore, HAADF-STEM, XPS, and other characterizations con\ufb01rmed the synthesis of the Rh2P structure. The promotion e\ufb00ect of P was bifunctional. On the one hand, the doped P separated the surface Rh atoms, which eliminated the surface hollow sites and prevented excessively strong adsorption of the reactants. On the other hand, electrons transferred from Rh to P, causing the surface Rh atoms to be positively charged, which was favorable for hydroformylation reactions.

Through cooperativity and synergism, these structures provide a fertile ground for catalyst discovery. Understanding these materials at the atomic scale and how to tune their electronic properties will be key for designing novel catalysts for selective chemistries. Here, we use density functional theory calculations and \ufb01rst-principles microkinetic modeling to unveil extensive mechanistic knowledge about the cooperativity of atomically dispersed Rh\u2212ReOx pairs on the \u03b3-alumina support for the hydroformylation of ethylene to propanal. By considering a number of possible pre-catalyst complexes, we con\ufb01rm that the most stable one is a Rh gem-dicarbonyl species, Rh(CO)2, which, contrary to the homogeneous Wilkinson complex, assumes a 16-electron square-planar geometry by coordinating to two alumina surface oxygen atoms. We \ufb01nd the weakening of the Rh\u2212CO coordinative bonds with increasing ReOx loading, con\ufb01rming an earlier experimental work. We develop mechanisms for two competing reactions, ethylene hydroformylation and hydrogenation, and show that they reproduce experimental observations and trends such as reaction kinetics and, most critically, the increase in hydroformylation selectivity in the presence of ReOx. In these mechanisms, the catalyst is activated by the dissociation of one of the two CO ligands of Rh(CO)2 to allow ethylene and H2 coordination, in that order, and we provide evidence that H2 dissociation on Rh is not oxidative. We determine the hydroformylation rate-limiting step and show that it depends on the local environment of Rh: in the absence of ReOx, the hydroformylation is controlled by the acylation step and requires octahedrally coordinated Rh, namely, re-binding of a CO ligand prior to the acylation; in the presence of ReOx, and owing to the weakening of the Rh\u2212CO bonds, the requisite CO coordination prior to the insertion step becomes rate-controlling. We assert that ReOx steers the reaction toward propanal by impeding a critical rearrangement of the Rh ligands that favors the competing reaction, ethylene hydrogenation.

The addition of Co tuned the electronic environment of surface Rh atoms without changing the crystal structure, and the reaction activity showed a volcano relationship with the Co ratio. DFT calculations showed that Co doping decreased the overall activation energy of surface reactions and destabilized H2 adsorption simultaneously. When x \u2264 2 for Rh8\u2212xCoxP4/SiO2 catalysts, surface Rh atoms had positive valence and H2 adsorption was exothermic. Therefore, the hydroformylation rate was mainly determined by surface reaction with a \ufb01rst order of styrene concentration. When x > 2, however, surface Rh atoms were negatively charged and H2 adsorption became thermodynamically unfavorable. The reaction activity was then determined by H2 adsorption and was independent of styrene concentration. We introduced \u03b4E, which was the sum of overall activation energy and H2 coadsorption energy with styrene, to predict activity. Moderate addition of Co decreased the value of \u03b4E and promoted the activity, while excessive doping would increase \u03b4E.

The di\ufb00erence in the kinetic behavior between ethylene and propylene was investigated by measuring the reaction orders and apparent activation energies, and these macrokinetic observables were analyzed using the degree of rate control (DRC) method.

When the reactant was changed from ethylene to propylene, the IR peak corresponding to adsorbed CO exhibited a signi\ufb01cant increase, while the IR peaks of the alkyl group decreased in magnitude. Combined with the DRIFTS results, DRC analysis indicates that the \ufb01rst step of ole\ufb01n hydroformylation, the formation of an alkyl group on the catalyst surface, plays a key role in the di\ufb00erence between ethylene and propylene. This step is kinetically nonrelevant when ethylene is the reactant, but it is one of the rate-controlling steps for propylene. The low concentration of the adsorbed propyl group, which is a common intermediate shared by both hydroformylation and hydrogenation of propylene, decreases the rates of both reaction pathways as compared to ethylene.

Realizing the potential bene\ufb01ts of these catalysts requires active site uniformity and control of their local environment. Here, we propose a catalyst synthesis route for manipulating the local environment of atomically dispersed metal-active sites. This was achieved via the targeted deposition of Rh precursors near atomically dispersed ReOx on \u03b3-Al2O3 using electrostatic interactions. CO probe molecule infrared spectroscopy and aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy suggested that Rh could be preferentially located near a single ReOx species or multiple ReOx species by controlling ReOx loading. Rh\u2212ReOx interactions promoted catalytic reactivity and selectivity for ethylene hydroformylation. Kinetic measurements suggested that ReOx species withdrew charge from Rh, weakening Rh\u2212CO interactions, which promoted the concentration of vacant sites under reaction conditions and in turn catalytic reactivity. This work demonstrates a general synthetic approach for creating atomically dispersed heteroatom species consisting of oxophilic and late-transition metals and the importance of regulating the local environment of atomically dispersed metals for maximizing catalytic performance.
